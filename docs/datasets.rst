Datasets
-------------

On top of the causal inference models, this library also offers datasets to validate said models.
In real life, knowing the causal effect of a particular action would require knowing what would have happened if you hadn't done that,
which is impossible. For that reason most of this libraries datasets are synthethic, which allow us to know for sure the real treatment effect.
